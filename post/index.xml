      <description>What is Asynchronous I/O ? Input and output i.e I/O operations on a computer can be very slow compared to the processing of data i.e CPU intensive work. An I/O device can incorporate mechanical devices that must physically move, such as a hard drive seeking a track to read or write; this is often orders of magnitude slower than the switching of electric current. For example, during a disk operation that takes ten milliseconds to perform, a processor that is clocked at one gigahertz could have performed ten million instruction-processing cycles.</description>
